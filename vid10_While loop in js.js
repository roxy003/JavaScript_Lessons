/*
While loop executes code based on condition.
  NOTE:  if the condition never becomes false, the loop will never end and this
  might crash the runtime.
  In while loop first condition is checked then block runs.

//Practice of do while loop
let animalnames = {

  Swan: "aged 5",
  tiger: "aged 9",
  Dolphin: "aged 10",
  elephant: "aged 20",
